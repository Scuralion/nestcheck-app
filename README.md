An android app created for blue-and-great-tits-monitoring project. Within the Project, students would receive a different list of nesting boxes to monitor each day and set out to the local forrest, collecting data on nest-building-progression, eggs present and birds spotted near the nest.
The app makes this easy by providing a map, highlighting the location of each box and facilitating easy notekeeping of observations.
It also allows to upload and format the collected data into a shared excel spread sheet located within a shared dropbox folder.
While it is highly customized to its specific task, I hope it can inspire fellow junior researchers with an interest in app-development to develop custom solutions for your research questions.
